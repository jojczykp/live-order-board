## Comments

- Requirement about different _Summary_ ordering for BUYs and SELLs suggests that we have two independent status
  sections, with no price merging between them.

- TDD/BDD (given/when/then) for testing.

- Self-commenting code (mostly).

- [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle),
  [YAGNI](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html)
  (no overengineering; i.e. no factories, interfaces introduced since problem is very simple :) )

- Standard Maven project structure.
